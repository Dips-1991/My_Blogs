### *Data Types*

* Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
    
* Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (objects) of these classes.
    
* Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string, lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc
    
* To check what is the data type (class) of the variable used, we can simply write:Â  `your_variable=100`Â  `type(your_variable)`

### *Data Structures*

Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending on the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

* ***Lists:*** Python Lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type
    
* ***Tuple:*** Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.
    
* ***Dictionary:*** Python dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a Dictionary holds the `key:value` pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized

### ***Tasks:***

1. **Give the Difference between List, Tuple, and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.**
    
    ***List:***
    
    * A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets.
        
    * Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.
        
    * Lists can store any type of element.

    ***Tuple:***
    
    * A tuple is anÂ orderedÂ collection of data.
        
    * Tuples areÂ immutable.
        
    * Tuples are enclosed within parentheses.

    ***Set:***
    
    * A set is anÂ unorderedÂ collection.
        
    * Sets areÂ mutableÂ and haveÂ no duplicate elements.
        
    * Sets are represented in curly brackets.

2. **Create the below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favorite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.**
    
    **fav\_tools = { 1:"Linux", 2:"Git", 3:"Docker", 4:"Kubernetes", 5:"Terraform", 6:"Ansible", 7:"Chef" }**

3. **Create a List of cloud service providers**
    
    * **eg. cloud\_providers = \["AWS", "GCP", "Azure"\]**
        
    * Write a program to add \`Digital Ocean\` to the list of cloud\_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.
